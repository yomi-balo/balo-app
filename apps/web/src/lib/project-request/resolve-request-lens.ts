 *  1. platform admin → **observer**, regardless of any other relationship (admins

 *  2. company match (`user.companyId === request.companyId`) → **client** owner.

 *  4. else → `null` (unauthorised).
 *
 * `canSeeContact = lens !== 'client'` — experts on invite + admins see the named
 * contact; the client does not see their own identity surfaced as a "Contact".
 *
 * DELIBERATELY `activeMode`-AGNOSTIC: the lens is keyed on `platformRole` /
 * `companyId` / `expertProfileId` only — authorization derives from company
 * ownership, a live request↔expert relationship, or platform role, NOT the
 * viewer's current UI mode. An invited expert browsing in client mode (or vice
 * versa) still resolves to the relationship-derived lens. (A2 thread-scoping must
 * not assume `activeMode` aligns with the lens.)
