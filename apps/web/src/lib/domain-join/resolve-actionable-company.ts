/**
 * Re-derive the actionable COMPANY that owns the session user's email domain —
 * the SAME read chain as `resolveOnboardingCompanyAction`, returning only the
 * authoritative party id + mode the write actions need. ZERO client input: the
 * party is never trusted from the browser (IDOR guard). Returns `null` when there
 * is no actionable company match (→ callers fail CLOSED).
 *
 * BAL-348 HARD SECURITY GATE: an unverified session must NEVER be able to
 * interstitial join / request-to-join a domain-matched company. `SessionUser` carries
 * no `emailVerified`, so this reads `users.emailVerified` from the DB (keyed by
 * `userId`) and FAILS CLOSED — an unverified or missing user resolves to `null`,
 * mirroring `runDomainJoin`'s step-1 `unverified` stand-down. The DB read is placed
 * AFTER the cheap email/domain/blocked guards (no needless read when there is
 * obviously no usable corporate domain) and BEFORE the owner lookup.
 *
 * Reachable as of BAL-369: `isActionableDomainMatch` stands down for a PERSONAL
 * workspace, but once the owning company is promoted to a shared organization at
 * the onboarding Intent step its `isPersonal` flips false, so a same-domain
 * signup resolves to an actionable company here (same predicate the detect engine
 * reads). Still fails CLOSED to `null` on any non-actionable match.
