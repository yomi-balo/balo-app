 * PURE and dependency-free: NO `@balo/db`, NO `postgres`, NO logging, NO I/O. It
 * lives behind the `@balo/shared/authz` subpath (mirroring `@balo/shared/domains`)
 * precisely so EVERY layer can reach it without a circular or bundle dependency:
 *   - `apps/web` client components (e.g. `billing-capture.ts`) — bundle-safe
 *   - `apps/web` server seam (`lib/authz`) — wraps this with a live role lookup
 *   - `@balo/db` repositories (e.g. `listAdminUserIds`) — derives the admin-role
 *     set from `rolesWithCapability` instead of hardcoding `role IN ('owner',...)`
 *   - `apps/api` notification resolver
 *
 * Keeping this the ONLY role→capability interpretation point means a role string
 * is never re-read anywhere else (HARD CONSTRAINT B — no drift).
